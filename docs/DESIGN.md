# World Demo — Design Document

> A simplified xianxia cultivation RPG. Work in progress.

## Open Questions

Before diving deep, we need to nail these down:

1. **Perspective** — 2D top-down? 2D side-scroll? 3D?
2. **Engine** — Godot / Unity / Unreal / something else?
3. **Core pillars** — Which 2-3 mechanics are the heart of the game?
   - Cultivation/progression?
   - Combat?
   - NPC relationships/social?
   - Exploration?
   - Sect politics?
4. **Scope** — What does a playable prototype look like?
5. **Art style** — Pixel? Hand-drawn? 3D low-poly? Ink/brush?
6. **Solo or team?**
7. **Target platform** — PC only? Mobile too?

## Inspiration

- 鬼谷八荒 (Tale of Immortal) — core cultivation loop, open world
- What to keep, what to simplify, what to do differently?
